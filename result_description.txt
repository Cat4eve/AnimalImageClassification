We trained our model using a dataset comprising 4,000 images for training (400 images per class) and 1,000 images for validation (100 images per class).
The training process lasted for 10 epochs, resulting in remarkable outcomes. At the conclusion of the final epoch,
our model achieved an impressive train loss of 0.0478 and a validation loss of 0.2222. The train accuracy of the model was an outstanding 0.9847, demonstrating its ability to effectively learn from the training data. Similarly, the validation accuracy reached a commendable level of 0.9415,
indicating that the model performs well on unseen data. For the test dataset, the model yielded the following results:
Test Loss: 0.2309216558933258 and Test Accuracy: 0.9649999737739563.
